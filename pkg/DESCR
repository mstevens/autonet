autonet is a simple wifi network chooser. When you run it, it scans
for known wifi networks. If it sees one that it recognizes, it will
create an appropriate hostname.if(5) file and exec /etc/netstart
<ifname>.

autonet does not continuously monitor for network changes in the
background. It doesn't show you a list of networks and ask you to
pick one. It doesn't communicate over dbus. It has no runtime
configuration whatsoever -- if you want to add a new network, you
need to recompile it. You run it whenever you want to get onto a
known wireless network, it finds a network for you and connects to
it, and then it exits. If you're in a cafe and need to figure out
which network to connect to, just scan and configure with ifconfig(8).
